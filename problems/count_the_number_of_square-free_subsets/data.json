Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>non-empty</strong>&nbsp;<strong>subset</strong> of <code>nums</code> is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from <code>nums</code>.

The product of its elements is 3, which is a square-free integer.\n- The subset consisting of the 3<sup>rd</sup> element [5]. The product of its elements is 5, which is a square-free integer.\n- The subset consisting of 0<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> elements [3,5].
