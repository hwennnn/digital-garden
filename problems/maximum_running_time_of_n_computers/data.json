{"questionId": "2263", "questionFrontendId": "2141", "questionTitle": "Maximum Running Time of N Computers", "questionTitleSlug": "maximum-running-time-of-n-computers", "content": "<p>You have <code>n</code> computers. You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>batteries</code> where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> battery can <strong>run</strong> a computer for <code>batteries[i]</code> minutes. You are interested in running <strong>all</strong> <code>n</code> computers <strong>simultaneously</strong> using the given batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, you can insert <strong>at most one battery</strong> into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery <strong>any number of times</strong>. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of minutes you can run all the </em><code>n</code><em> computers simultaneously.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/06/example1-fit.png\" style=\"width: 762px; height: 150px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 4\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nInitially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.\nAfter two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.\nAt the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.\nBy the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.\nWe can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.\n\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/06/example2.png\" style=\"width: 629px; height: 150px;\" />\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nInitially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. \nAfter one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. \nAfter another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.\nWe can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= batteries.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= batteries[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n", "difficulty": "Hard", "stats": "{\"totalAccepted\": \"10K\", \"totalSubmission\": \"25.9K\", \"totalAcceptedRaw\": 10011, \"totalSubmissionRaw\": 25863, \"acRate\": \"38.7%\"}", "similarQuestions": "[{\"title\": \"Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements\", \"titleSlug\": \"minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements\", \"difficulty\": \"Medium\", \"translatedTitle\": null}, {\"title\": \"Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls\", \"titleSlug\": \"sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls\", \"difficulty\": \"Medium\", \"translatedTitle\": null}, {\"title\": \"Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign\", \"titleSlug\": \"maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign\", \"difficulty\": \"Hard\", \"translatedTitle\": null}, {\"title\": \"Minimum Time to Complete Trips\", \"titleSlug\": \"minimum-time-to-complete-trips\", \"difficulty\": \"Medium\", \"translatedTitle\": null}, {\"title\": \"Minimum Amount of Time to Fill Cups\", \"titleSlug\": \"minimum-amount-of-time-to-fill-cups\", \"difficulty\": \"Easy\", \"translatedTitle\": null}]", "categoryTitle": "Algorithms", "topicTags": [{"name": "Array", "slug": "array"}, {"name": "Binary Search", "slug": "binary-search"}, {"name": "Greedy", "slug": "greedy"}, {"name": "Sorting", "slug": "sorting"}], "normalized_title": "maximum_running_time_of_n_computers"}
