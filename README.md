# Leetcode Solutions

Welcome to my Leetcode solutions collection! This site contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized and documented for easy reference.

## Why Separate Branch?

I've created a separate `leetcode` branch to deploy LeetCode solutions independently from my main content. This separation was necessary because:

1. The LeetCode collection has grown to over 2,200 problems and solutions
2. Having all content in one branch was significantly slowing down hot reloads during development
3. The large number of files was hindering progress on writing other notes

## Deployment

The LeetCode solutions are now deployed to a dedicated subdomain:

- ðŸ”— [leetcode.hwendev.com](https://www.leetcode.hwendev.com/)

## Content Updates

I will be regularly syncing new LeetCode solutions using an automated [script](https://github.com/hwennnn/leetcode-sync).

This setup allows me to:

- Maintain faster development cycles for non-LeetCode content
- Keep LeetCode solutions organized in their own space
- Continue adding solutions without impacting the main site's performance
